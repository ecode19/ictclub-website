                            <span class="text-primary fs-4">Cybersecurity.</span> is the practice of protecting digital
                            systems, networks, and devices from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. With the
                            increasing use of digital devices and online transactions, cybersecurity has become a
                            critical aspect of protecting personal and business information. In the ICT Club
                            Cybersecurity program, members will learn how to protect digital systems from cyber threats
                            and how to implement security measures to prevent cyber attacks.
