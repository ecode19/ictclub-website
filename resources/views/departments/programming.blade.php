                            on teaching students how to write code and develop computer programs using various
                            programming languages and tools. The class is designed to introduce students to the basics
                            of programming, including programming concepts, data types, control structures, and
                            algorithms. Students will also learn how to use different programming environments and
                            tools, such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), compilers, and debuggers.
