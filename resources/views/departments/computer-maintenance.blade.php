                            computer systems to ensure they are running efficiently and effectively. It includes tasks
                            such as updating software, cleaning hardware components, and performing regular backups of
                            important data. In the ICT Club Computer Maintenance program, members will learn how to
                            diagnose and troubleshoot computer problems, perform hardware and software upgrades, and
                            maintain the health and performance of computer systems. The program will also cover topics
                            such as virus and malware protection, data recovery, and system optimization to ensure that
                            members have the knowledge and skills necessary to keep their computers running smoothly.
